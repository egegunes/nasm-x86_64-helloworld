# nasm-x86_64-helloworld

It's a simple hello world application in [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/index.php). Why? Because my colleague [Okan Binli](https://github.com/peyloride) challenged me.

## Build

```
$ make
```

## Run

```
$ ./hello
```

Program prints "Hello, Ege" first then waits user input. Type "Okan" and press
Enter, it prints "Hello, Okan".
